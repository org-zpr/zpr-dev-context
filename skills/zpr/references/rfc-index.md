# ZPR RFC Index

Two sources:

1. **Full set (internal)**: distributed to team members as `ZPR_RFC-<n>[.<rev>].pdf`
   and `.docx` files. The highest `<rev>` for a given `<n>` is current
   (`ZPR_RFC-8.5.pdf` supersedes `ZPR_RFC-8.pdf`). Only a subset is public.
2. **Public subset**: https://github.com/org-zpr/zpr-rfcs — sources in `src/`,
   built PDFs in `pdf/` (https://github.com/org-zpr/zpr-rfcs/tree/main/pdf).

The PDFs have a clean text layer; `pdftotext` extracts them fine.

## Suggested reading order

1. RFC 12 — the overview; what ZPR is and why.
2. RFC 4 — terminology; settles what "visa", "actor", "substrate" etc. mean.
3. RFC 15 (then 8 for depth) — the ZPL policy language.
4. RFC 16 / 13 — identity, authentication, attributes.
5. RFC 14 — why visas exist; useful before touching `libeval` or `vs`.
6. RFC 6 / 17 — data protocols and ZDP; needed for adapter/forwarding work.
7. RFC 7 — topology, address assignment, forwarding.
